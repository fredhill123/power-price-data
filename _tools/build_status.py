"""Publish status.csv — the health record the Excel staleness banner reads.

The workbook pulls this like any other query and compares it against TODAY() on the
user's machine, so the banner fires without anyone here noticing anything is wrong.

Columns (one data row):
  generated_utc         when this file was written (i.e. when the refresh last ran)
  coverage_end          last hour of actual data
  last_complete_year    latest fully-complete calendar year in the data
  frozen_history_end    last year in master_fixed.parquet (what CI builds on)
  charts_built_for_year the year the delivered charts' series were generated for
  expected_refresh_days how many days may pass before a refresh is considered overdue
