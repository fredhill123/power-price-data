config.py — canonical configuration for the ENTSO-E power-price data system.

Countries: Germany (DE-LU), France, Spain, Portugal, Italy.
Range:     2019-01-01 .. present (2026 is YTD).
Timebase:  everything is stored on an HOURLY UTC canonical timeline (DST-safe).

Key design decisions (locked with Fred, 2026-07-16):
  * Italy has no single national day-ahead price -> we build a load-weighted
    PUN *proxy* across the Italian bidding zones. Generation / load / flows /
    capacity for Italy are queried at national "IT" level (verified to work).
  * Intraday "hour-of-day" analytics bucket by UTC hour (Fred's choice, 2026-07-16).
    THE COST, now that six markets share these axes: a market's local solar peak lands
    at a different x position depending on its offset from UTC. Portugal has always sat
    an hour left of the four CET markets, and Great Britain now does too. On the
    intraday-shape, solar-peak and duck exhibits that is a real, visible misalignment
    between countries, not a rounding matter. It stays UTC because the decision was
    taken deliberately and reversing it would move every existing series; the exhibits
    that compare markets say so on the axis. Revisit only as a deliberate choice.
  * Charts to reproduce: Redburn Figs 1-6 (ENTSO-E), + Fig 7 (intraday gen mix)
    + Fig 9 (annual capacity).

# exactly 1 + 5 x 17. Unlike the Phase-4 tabs, add_power_queries.py does NOT rebuild
# them, so their width does not follow their CSV. Publishing a 103-column CSV into an
# 86-column table puts every GB column OUTSIDE the table, where a chart cannot see it
# and a refresh does not reach it. Widening them means rewriting table, queryTable and
# column definitions on inherited parts, which is the exact surgery that silently
# un-curated chart12 on 2026-07-22.
#
# It costs nothing, because the CHARTS DO NOT READ THESE TABS. Every annual bar chart
# reads Fig5_Window or Fig9_Window and every line chart reads Line_Window, all three of
# which add_power_queries rebuilds from their CSV each run, so their width tracks the
# country list on its own and GB arrives there with no surgery at all.
