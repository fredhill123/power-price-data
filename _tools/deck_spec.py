"""
deck_spec.py — THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the Hourly Power Data deck.

Every builder reads this and nothing else for structure/captions/identity:
  * build_deck.py          (linked deck)   — uses caption, box, chart#
  * build_static_deck.py   (static deck)   — uses caption, box, png
  * render_all.py          (static charts) — uses png, render recipe
  * build_frozen_excel.py  (frozen wb)     — inherits the workbook charts (no change here)
  * check_consistency.py                    — asserts the built decks match THIS

Change an exhibit HERE and every output follows. Adding/moving/relabelling a chart
is a one-place edit; check_consistency.py fails the build if any output drifts.

Each exhibit:
  id        stable key (also the render_all PNG stem for chart exhibits)
  caption   navy exhibit-bar text — IDENTICAL in both decks
  box       "L" | "R" | "1up"
  chart     linked-workbook chart number (xl/charts/chartN.xml), or None for image-only
  png       PNG filename (deck_charts/ for charts, deck_img/ for snapshots)
  render    recipe dict for render_all (kind + params); None = pre-rendered snapshot

Year policy (locked 2026-07-18): single-year exhibits (fig6, fig7) = LATEST COMPLETE
year in both paths; intraday profiles keep the current partial year labelled "YTD".
