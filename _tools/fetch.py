fetch.py — pull all raw ENTSO-E series and cache to Parquet.

Series per country / year (UTC-year boundaries):
  price_<zone>   day-ahead prices (one file per price zone; IT has several)
  load           actual total load (national)
  load_<zone>    actual load per price zone  (IT only, for PUN weighting)
  generation     actual aggregated generation per production type (national)
  flow_import    physical cross-border flows INTO the country (all borders, +sum)
  flow_export    physical cross-border flows OUT of the country (all borders, +sum)
  capacity       annual installed generation capacity per type

Everything is stored with a tz-aware UTC DatetimeIndex. Resampling to the hourly
canonical timeline happens later in build_hourly.py.

Resumable: an existing, non-empty parquet for (country, series, year) is skipped
unless --force. For incremental updates, re-run with --years <latest> --force.

Usage:
  python fetch.py                       # everything, all countries, all years
  python fetch.py --country DE          # one country
  python fetch.py --country DE --years 2024   # one country-year (smoke test)
  python fetch.py --force               # re-fetch even if cached

    WHY, measured 2026-08-26 against the live API for the exact German generation window
    that had just failed in production:

        one request, 2026-01-01..2026-08-26   FAILED, HTTP 504 after 180s
        eight monthly requests                ALL SUCCEEDED, 341s total

    A 504 is a gateway giving up on generating a huge response, not a rate limit, so
    retrying the identical request cannot work. Production retried it three times with 20s,
    40s and 80s backoff and then gave up, spending 16 minutes to fetch nothing and falling
    back to a stored copy. entsoe-py will not split it for us: `query_generation` carries
    `@year_limited`, which cuts at year boundaries and nowhere else, so any sub-year window
    is a single HTTP request.

    WHY ONE REQUEST FIRST, rather than always splitting. Measured the same day, on a
    two-month window that ENTSO-E serves happily:

        one request      76.5s
        monthly blocks  196.4s     (identical data: same 5,852 rows, 17 columns, 0 diffs)

    So splitting costs about 2.6x whenever the whole window would have worked, and the
    trailing-window fetch this normally runs is exactly that case. Always chunking would
    have made the common path slower to fix the rare one.

    An earlier version of this rejected "split on failure" outright, on the grounds that
    each 504 costs a full timeout before the code learns anything. That objection is real
    but it only bites RECURSIVE halving, which pays a timeout PER LEVEL while it searches
    for a size that works. Falling back once, straight to months, pays exactly one timeout
    and then behaves optimally. The measurements say that is the better trade: about 120s
    saved on every healthy fetch, against 180s added on a failing one that was previously
    fetching nothing at all.

    Only a TRANSIENT failure triggers the fallback. A malformed request would fail the same
    way twelve times over, so it propagates immediately.

    A window inside a single month is passed straight through, since there is nothing to
    fall back to.

    A block with nothing published is skipped rather than fatal: ENTSO-E legitimately has
    no data for some markets in some months, and one empty January must not discard the
    other seven months. Only a window where EVERY block is empty raises, which is the same
    signal a single empty request would have given.

# request, the status page offered the same advice, and the issue said "retry the workflow, it
# is usually nothing else".
#
# On 2026-09-02 that was wrong in the way that costs days. ENTSO-E began refusing query windows
# longer than one month; the pinned entsoe-py kept sending them and got HTTP 400 on load,
# generation and both cross-border series for all five ENTSO-E markets. Two repair runs fired
# and failed identically, because no retry can make a malformed request well-formed. It took a

# for a bounded time, and only saying so.
#
# WHY THIS DOES NOT UNDO THE 2026-08-03 DECISION. That decision removed the raw cache so
# every run re-pulls the whole year and any stored file that has gone bad is replaced. That
# still holds: a series that fetches SUCCESSFULLY overwrites, exactly as before. Only a
# series that FAILED leans on storage, and the bound caps how long it may.
#
# THE COVERAGE GUARD IS THE TIGHTER BOUND, AND IT DECIDES (measured 2026-08-23).
# This was 8, on the reasoning that one whole slot gap is the natural limit. That number was
# never reachable. check_coverage.py refuses to publish a column that lost more than BOTH 3
# cells AND 2% of what it had, and on a daily-resolution column in late August 2% is about
# 4.7 cells — so a 5-day-old fallback is REFUSED at publish and an 8-day one never had a
# chance. Documenting 8 as the bound would have sent someone hunting through the fetch logs
# for a failure that was actually a publish-time coverage refusal.
#
# Three is chosen because it is provably inside the guard at every time of year, which no
# larger number is: a 3-day-behind daily column loses exactly 3 cells, and the guard needs
# a drop STRICTLY GREATER than 3 before the percentage is even consulted. That floor is what
# saves January, when 2% of a year barely started is a single cell. On the long hourly feeds
# 3 days is ~72 rows of 6,200, which is under the 2% as well.
