"""Offline guard: a transient ENTSO-E 5xx must not cost a whole series, and a fetch that
did not fetch must fail its own step.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-18 the DE generation pull returned HTTP 504 twice. fetch.py
logged FAIL and exited 0. Every run re-pulls the whole year with no raw cache, so nothing
was stored for DE generation 2026; net load (demand - wind - solar) was therefore empty for
that year; add_phase4_charts.py emits one series per year column that HAS data, so chart19
was built with 7 series; and roll_line_windows.py, which requires exactly 8 to match the
shared rolling window, aborted the build. The pipeline published nothing for eight days and
the only visible symptom was a message about chart geometry.

    ~/.claude/pyenv/bin/python3 _tools/fetch_retry_test.py

No network, and no entsoe package needed: the client is stubbed at import, because none of
the behaviour under test goes near it.
