/**
 * Power Price Data — public status & refresh page.
 *
 * A Cloudflare Worker, deliberately NOT a Pages deploy: Fred's `fredhill` Pages project is
 * gated by Cloudflare Access on `fredhill.pages.dev` and `*.fredhill.pages.dev`, and this
 * page has to be public. Workers are a separate product on a separate hostname
 * (`*.workers.dev`), so nothing here can widen or weaken that gate.
 *
 * What it does
 *   GET  /          status page: when the data was last refreshed, whether that is healthy,
 *                   when the next scheduled run is due, download links, data browser.
 *   POST /trigger   dispatches the GitHub Actions workflow.
 *
 * Why the trigger is POST-only
 *   A GET that changes state gets fired by accident: Teams, Slack, Outlook and WhatsApp all
 *   fetch links to build previews, as do scanners and browser prefetch. Paste a GET trigger
 *   into a chat and it starts a 20-minute job, then again on every re-share. POST is not
 *   followed by link unfurlers.
 *
 * Rate limiting is stateless: before dispatching we ask GitHub whether a run is already in
 * progress or finished recently, and refuse if so. No KV, nothing to expire, and it also
 * stops two people double-triggering.
 *
 * The token (GH_TOKEN) is a Worker secret — fine-grained, Actions:write on this one repo,
 * nothing else. It is never sent to the browser.

// opens it and looks. That is the workbook's design, not this page's.

// The ONLY files this Worker will serve, by exact name. An allowlist rather than a path check,
// because a path check on a proxy is how a proxy becomes a way to read the rest of a repository.
// Three of them, Fred's pick 2026-08-17: the snapshot deck and the CSV browse card were dropped as
// clutter, keeping the two anyone actually opens plus the deck that goes with them.

// without exposing the history. On GitHub it cannot: a public repository puts Commits and History
// in the same view as any folder, one click from a /tree/ link, and there is no setting that
// separates them. Making the history private would mean making the repository private, which
// would break the workbook's own fetches. So the files are listed HERE instead, which shows the
// same thing, keeps every link same-origin, and leaves the 2026-08-17 decision intact.
